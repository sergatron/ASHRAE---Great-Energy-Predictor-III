# Usage
For reproducibility, this repo may be cloned. Once cloned, scripts must be executed sequentially to clean data and train model. Then the web app may be run locally. 

In general, the following steps need to performed:
 1. Clone repo
 2. **TODO**: add script to clean data
 3. Train model
 4. Run web app


Copy repo:

```$ git clone https://github.com/sergatron/ASHRAE---Great-Energy-Predictor-III.git```

Train model:

```python models/lgbm_model.py```

Run web app:

```python app/run.py```
